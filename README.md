**NASHVILLE HOUSING DATASET- DATA CLEANING WITH POSTGRESQL**

In this project, I made use of the dataset called NavilleHousing which could be found from here: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx

The dataset represents the information about the housing in Nashville, the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Tennessee. Columns represent the information about 
house address, owner, acrage, number of rooms, and so on

As the title indicated, I would like to demonstrate my data cleaning skills by using Postgresql (i.e: handle missing values, mismatch in data value;  add useful columns by extracting information from some existing columns, etc)
